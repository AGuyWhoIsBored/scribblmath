# SCRIBBL MATH 

Being in a worldwide pandemic, teaching mathematics has certainly become a struggle for both students and teachers. We have all been in that one Zoom call where your math teacher is trying to explain some sort of concept, and due to the lack of tools available, it simply isn't a good time for anyone.

Inspired from the lack of math functionality on most video chat platforms, our team created a web application focused on accommodating students and teachers alike for their math needs. ScribblMath is a video chatting platform that implements the staples of video chat like webcams and a chat, but also adds elements that are crucial to conveying complex mathematics in an easy way. These primarily include a virtual drawing board as well as LaTeX math typesetting support in the chat box! This means that your teacher will no longer have to spend hours trying to type out the correct math equation or attempt to draw the ten symbols that each of the equations has that you learned that day. It will look just like the way it does in your textbook!!

This is our (Duncan Applegarth, Justin Chang) submission for COVID Hacks 2020!
